# Lymphocytosis classification
* The main objective of this challenge is the diagnosis of lymphocytosis. In clinical practice,
this diagnosis relies on visual microscopic examination of blood cells, as well as consideration
of clinical attributes such as age and blood lymphocyte count. Among the characteristics
observed are the texture and size of the lymphocytes. There’s every reason to believe that
the use of deep learning and computer vision techniques will improve diagnostic repro-
ducibility.
* For this challenge, we have at our disposal data from 142 subjects with 44 reactive cases
and 98 malignant cases. The model is evaluated on 42 subjects on Kaggle. For each subject
in the training set, we have an indeterminate number of blood smears (which complied with
certain inclusion criteria: lymphocyte count greater than 4 ∗ 109/L, and absence of oppo-
sition to research) and the patient’s clinical attributes (date of birth, lymphocyte count,
diagnostic label).
